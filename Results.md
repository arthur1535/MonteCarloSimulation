In this histogram, we visualize the **distribution of final stock prices**:
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Prices **below** the target price set by the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: Prices that **hit** the target price.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Prices that **exceeded** the target price.

### Interpretation:
- Most prices are concentrated **below** the target price (red region).
- The purple region indicates the scenarios where the target price was achieved.
- The green region represents optimistic cases where the target price was exceeded.
