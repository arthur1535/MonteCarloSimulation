# Monte Carlo Simulation for VIVT3 (Vivo) Stock Prediction  

This project uses Monte Carlo simulations to predict potential stock prices of VIVT3 (Vivo) over one year. The model estimates the number of times the stock may reach a target price based on historical data and statistical analysis.  

## Features  
- Simulates stock price movements over 252 trading days using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).  
- Generates visualizations:  
  - Price simulation paths.  
  - Distribution of final prices with custom colors.  
- Calculates statistical insights:  
  - Mean growth, standard deviation, and confidence intervals.  
  - Percentage breakdown of price increases, stability, and decreases.
